# guess-my-number
Small project I made to practice JS called "Guess a number"

The correct number is always between 1 and 20.
Functionalities:

-If guess is wrong (too low or too high) you get a warning message and you lose one score. (-1 each time the guess is wrong);
-If guess is correct, the score gets added to your high score;
-Play  again button
